# Project 1: Write a Data Science blog
For this project we pick a dataset and answer 3 questions using the data. The questions I pose are:

1.  Can we use Textblob package to establish the sentiment of text reviews of AirBNB properties in Seattle?
2. What are the common themes of the text reviews of AirBNB properties in Seattle?
3. Can we use the features of an AirBNB property to predict its eventual review sentiment or score?
